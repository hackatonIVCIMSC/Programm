Tasks and challenges

	CES and Community forge have been working for many years towards interoperability between community currency networks, but we have been stuck in a 'platforms' mentality. By switching to a REST API and 'mobile first' way of thinking we've come up with some easy ways that different platforms can start to work together. In this atelier targeted to the credit Commons Collective we'll be specifying and coding together, anticipating great gains in a short period of time.
